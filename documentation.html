<h1>H590 Data Visualization Interactive Visual Analytics Project 1</h1>

<h3>The Design Process</h3>
<p>At the beginning stage of the project, I created several sketches on the interface of the visualization. The main purpose of such sketches were to determine on the positions of elements that would be displayed on screen. Some of the sketches represent the whole screen, and some of the sketches represent the details of a graph—for example, several different display of variables to see if horizontal alignment or vertical alignment is better. Moreover, I tried creating a flow chart to see what options should be offered to users.  Although it does not cover the entire function of the visualization I created, it served its purpose in clearing out how menus should be grouped together. </p>
<p>This is the very first sketch I created. In the original design, the visualization consisted of two pages. The first picture shows the intro screen—which was not implemented in the actual visualization mainly due to time constraint—and the main screen that will display any graphs the user creates. </p>
<img src="H590project/note1.JPG" alt="sketches" style="width:400px;height:800px;">
<p>This is the second sketch, which shows more details on the main page for graphs. </p>
<p>This sketch contains multiple drawing on the possible representation of variables in one graph. <p>
<p>This is a flow chart I created in order to organize functionalities that should be supported at each stage. As the main reason for creating this chart was to see what functionalities to support in the main graph page, I focused on drawing only the parts that were related to one stage, instead of drawing whole set of actions.</p>
<p>This sketch is a finalized version for the main page design. I referred to this sketch throughout the implementation stage. </p>
<p>This is a finalized sketch for a second type of graph—comparison graph. </p>

<h3> Rationale of your design choices </h3>
Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?
<p>In the design perspective of this visualization design, my goal was maximizing convenience of the user. I aimed at cutting down steps to perform an action and increasing flexibility in data representation, as well as lowering possibility of user error.</p>
<ul>
<li>Titles: I put the titles at the top to make it easier for users to recognize what the chart is displaying. I also thought having a title above a graph would be also helpful when the users print out the page. </li>
<li>Graphs: 
<ul>
<li>Bar chart: I decided to put production data on x axis and consumption graph below x axis because I thought production was generally considered as positive and consumption as negative. In fact, I tried to create a grouped bar chart that displays both dataset on x axis side by side, but this was an alternative choice due to the limitation in my programming skills. But still, the vertical alignment of the graph enables the user to compare data from each year easily. <br> For the bar chart in the compare chart—the second page--, I tested a different approach. Since one of the regions was “world,” I thought it would be helpful to illustrate what portions of the total production or consumption of certain energy each region is responsible for. Therefore, I decided to draw two types of bar on the x axis, instead of placing it above and beneath the x axis as I did in the main chart. </li>
<li>Scatterplot: I added a mouseover function that enlarges a circle because it would help the user to see which data is being displayed. Also, the interactivity makes the graph more pleasurable to interact with. </li>
<li>Line graph: As I considered this graph as a supplementary aid that makes trend more prominent, I set the color of the line chart to be darker than other charts. As a result, the line is easy to find when it is added to bar chart or scatterplot.</li>
</li>
<li>Menu box: As my graph has a mouseover function and the graph is lined up horizontally, I thought it would be easier for the user to move mouse horizontally to access the menu box in regards to the flow of movement.</li>
<li>Graph type selection: Although it is possible to spot a trend with bar chart and scatterplot, I thought the trend would be even more easier to notice with the line graph, since then the eyes of users can follow the line. Therefore, I implemented line graph as an additional aid to the users. At the same time, I also wanted to offer the option to display only one graph at the time because some users may have preferences for certain graph types.</li>
<li>Energy type: Instead of displaying data from only one data file, I created an option for displaying production data, consumption data, or both data. By displaying two dataset on one graph, the users can recognize the differences between production and consumption at one sight. This design requires less effort on the user side than the design of displaying production and consumption in two separate charts. For example, in the latter design, the user has to look at two charts interchangeably to compare values, and the user has to make sure that he or she is comparing the data for same year every time. But with my current design, there is no need to check if two values are from the same year because the two values from the same year are lined up together vertically. </li>
<li>Year length: This is one additional feature to increase flexibility of graph. While the dataset contains data for more than 30 years, some users may only need a data for last ten years or five years. If the dataset has a fixed year span, the user would have to pay additional attention to find the starting point for the part of graph the user wants to utilize.  But with this visualization, by enabling the user to adjust the year span, the user can be ensured that the starting point of the graph correctly represents the starting point for the data the user needs. Therefore, this design decreases the possibility of user error. </li>
<li>Localities: Since there are too many countries and regions to display as checkbox or radio button, I chose to use a dropbox.</li>
<li>Restore Default: I added this feature to increase user convenience. If a user has been looking at the scatterplot with a line graph and decides he or she wants to see the data in bar chart, the user would have to make two mouse actions—unchecking line graph and selecting a radio button for bar chart. This button saves the effort. </li>
<li>Compare different regions: I put the button at the bottom of the menu bar because I predicted that the user will need this button after he or she finishes interacting with the current page. Thus, it is at the end of the menu box because this is the last button to be used on the page.<li>
<li>links to document page and video: I put the links below the graph, with blank space in between them, because I wanted to separate functions that directly interacts with the graph and those that do not. </li>

<h3> Findings with visualization </h3>
<p>The question I asked was “Which regions has the highest CO2 emission?” As my country is greatly affected by air pollution of China each year, I have grown up hearing many people in my country complaining that China is polluting the whole world. Therefore, I thought the answer was China, at least for the last five or ten years. But seeing the graph, it seems North America has a much bigger share in disrupting ecology. </p>
<p>This is a graph comparing “World” and “North America.” The emission per capita of North America is higher than the emission per capita for the world.</p>
<p>This is a graph comparing “North America”and “Asia & Oceania.” Compared to “North America,” it even seems the CO2 emission from “Asia & Oceania” would be an insignificant amount—which is not true.</p>
<p> At the same time, from this graph, I became interested in knowing what is causing this great CO2 emission because the trend in each region is very different from one another. In Asia and Oceania, it is steadily growing, while emission in Europe and North America has been stable but it is decreasing in recent few years. In Africa, it is stably low. </p>
<h3> References</h3>
<p>For this visualization, I built upon the sample code provided in the project page. For adding and activating elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes, I referred to lessons provided in W3schools. For implementing other functionalities such as scatterplot and tooltips, I referred to textbook “The Interactive Visualization for the Web”.
